# Molten Ironworks Changes
A datapack that makes some changes to the Fabric versions of [Create: Molten Metals](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-molten-metals) and [Create: Ironworks](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-ironworks), including:
 - Brass, bronze, steel, and netherite can now only be crafted with the molten alloying recipes
 - Molten alloying recipes have been adjusted to require the minimum ingredients (e.g. brass can craft with a nuggets worth of copper and zinc)
 - Steel ratio is 2 iron : 3 coal (6 charcoal) : 1 steel
 - Fixed the broken tin recipes from Ironworks
 - Adjusted slag drops, including adding tin and XP nuggets, and increased all the nugget drops from 1% to 5%
 - Added spout recipes for gold foods
